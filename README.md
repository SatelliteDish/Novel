# Novel-Lang
Novel is going to be a new esolang based off of a choose your own adventure novel. It is going to be statically typed and incredibly verbose, with a focus on making code into a book-like format. There will be much fewer symbols used than in most other languages.

## Syntax
Currently I'm just working on adding in proper math evaluation, so nothing works yet. I'll continue to try and keep this updated as I add more syntax.
